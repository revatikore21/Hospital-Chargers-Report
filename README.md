# Hospital-Charges-Report

## Project Overview
This project involves cleaning, organizing, and analyzing hospital charges data, specifically focusing on chest pain providers. The dataset in Sheet 1 has been cleaned, and Sheet 2 has been created by filtering relevant data from the cleaned main dataset.

## Project Steps
#### Step 1: Data Cleaning (Sheet 1)
- Sheet 1 (Main Data):
Initial dataset containing all hospital charges data.
Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary or duplicate entries, standardized column formats, and addressed missing or incorrect data.
- Result: The cleaned data is more structured and reliable for analysis.
#### Step 2: Filtering Data (Sheet 2)
- Sheet 2 (Chest Pain Providers):
- Filtered Data: The data from Sheet 1 was filtered to isolate hospital charges related to chest pain providers.
This filtered dataset forms the foundation for the final report, making it focused on chest pain cases.
#### Step 3: Basic Formatting
- Sheet: Chest Pain Providers (Sheet 2)
- Focused Columns:
 State, Average Covered Charges,  Average Total Payments, Average Medicare Payments
Have Group the State Columns By using "Flitering"
- Data Type:
Set column data types to "Number" and removed unnecessary decimals.
- Deleted Columns:
Removed 4 irrelevant columns to simplify the dataset.
- Freeze Panes:
Applied Freeze Panes on the top row to keep headers visible during scrolling.
Shortcut: Alt + W + F
#### Step 4: Conditional Formatting
- Applied conditional formatting with three conditions to highlight significant values or rows, particularly focusing on the last 3 rows for a clear understanding of critical data points.
#### Step 5: Advanced Formatting
- Create Table: Formatted the data into an Excel Table for better readability and ease of filtering and sorting.
Shortcut: Ctrl + L
- Header & Footer:
Added a header with the project title and footer with page numbers for a professional touch.
- Page Layout Adjustment:
Auto-adjusted the page layout to ensure the data fits on one page when printed.
Steps: Page Layout -> Width -> Set to 1 Page
